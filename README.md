Coding Exam


Object Constructors and Array Methods 
`(Use ES6 approach especially when writing functions and loops)`

Coding Exercise 1

Instructions:
1. Create an object for a Car with the following properties:
    Brand
    Model
    Year
    Color
    Mileage
    Price
2. Create three Car objects and assign values to their properties.
3. Write a function that takes an array of Car objects as a argument/parameter and returns the average price of all the cars in the array.

Coding Exercise 2

Instructions:
1. Create an object for a Book with the following properties:
    Title
    Author
    Pages
    Year
    Genre
2. Create three Book objects and assign values to their properties.
3. Write a function that takes an array of Book objects as a argument/parameter and returns an array of book titles that belong to a specific genre. ()

`Example filter function with argument, in this case “Fiction”.`

3. Write a function that takes the shopping cart array as a parameter and returns an array of all the items whose price is greater than the supplied amount (specified as a parameter to the function).

`Example output: (assume that this is the function call "getItemsAbovePrice(cart, 15)")`

Coding Exercise 4

Given:

<img src="./example8.png">

Note: The grades property is in array form and you need to iterate inside to manipulate the values.

Write a function that takes this array as a parameter and returns an array of objects representing the average grade for each student. Each object in the returned array should have the following properties:


- name (string)
- averageGrade (number, rounded to two decimal places)

`Example output:`
